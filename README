Follow the instructions to compile from:
http://wiki.compiz.org/C%2B%2BCompiling
replace the src direction from the git clone of core with the attached tar
before compiling compiz

things that use the mouse or workspace management generally dont work.
everything else should work ok.
you'll need to compile extra plugins etc.
